# annotations

Today I learned a bit about Java annotations over here

https://www.javatpoint.com/java-annotation

It was good to learn it. I'm planning to try it out now.

So I'm creating my own custom annotation called MyCustomAnnotation.
I have two methods in it - one has a default value, another doesn't.
I'm using this annotation in a class called Example class and when
we don't give a value to the method with no default value, compiler
throws error like this -

```bash
$ gradle build

> Task :compileJava FAILED
/Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/karuppiah7890/java-stuff/annotations/src/main/java/annotations/Example.java:3: error: annotation @MyCustomAnnotation is missing a default value for the element 'someBooleanValueWithNoDefault'
@MyCustomAnnotation()

Wikipedia talks about Java annotation - 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation

```
In the Java computer programming language, an annotation is a form of syntactic metadata
that can be added to Java source code.[1] Classes, methods, variables, parameters and
Java packages may be annotated. Like Javadoc tags, Java annotations can be read from
source files. Unlike Javadoc tags, Java annotations can also be embedded in and read
from Java class files generated by the Java compiler. This allows annotations to be
retained by the Java virtual machine at run-time and read via reflection.[2]
It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.[3]
```

So it's just metadata, but it has syntax - so metadata has to be given in some
proper format / syntax and compiler can check the syntax. It can be added
to different kinds of things - classes, methods and what not. I'm going to
try them one by one.

This metadata can be read from source files it seems. So, it's not simply
storing information, but also reading and using that information :) 

For the above error, when I give a value `false`, it tells this error

```bash
$ gradle build

> Task :compileJava FAILED

So, it's looking for a method named `value` in the annotation. Looks like that's the default
it considers when we give no name along with the value.

It works once we do this

```java
package annotations;

@MyCustomAnnotation(someBooleanValueWithNoDefault = false)
public class Example {
}
```

I'm going to use this `Example` class in a test method and see if I can read
the metadata that I just defined

I tried to use it but I got a null pointer exception to get the value out
of the annotation which I got from the class. I also got a warning from
Intellij. The error told that annotation class is not retained for
reflective access.

https://www.javatpoint.com/java-annotation has some references to
something called @Retention built in annotation which is used in
other (custom?) annotations. It has three possible values. I'm not
able to understand them yet, but the example code uses the value
`RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME` . I'm going to try to use different
policy values to see when the null pointer exception goes away!
Only with `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME` it works. 

I just learned a bit more from the points here

https://java2novice.com/java-annotations/retention-policy/

It says that the default is `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`

I also read a bit here

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/annotations.html#retention

There's a good example of how to create a simple unit test
framework using custom annotations @Test and @TestInfo

https://mkyong.com/java/java-custom-annotations-example/

It shows how the methods with the annotation @Test are
invoked

A lot of these places talk about "Java Reflection APIs".
It's something I need to learn soon.

One more basic link about annotations is here
http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/annotations.html

One more good explanation about retention policies here
https://dzone.com/articles/how-annotations-work-java

The crazy thing is, I'm not able to see the difference
between the three values - SOURCE, CLASS and RUNTIME.

I tried to check the class files, jar file, to see if
the annotation is present in the class file or not and
I see it's always there. Weird.

https://www.jorel.dev/blog/Java-Annotation-Retention-Source

I learned about the `javap` command and tried this out -

```bash
$ # with RetentionPolicy.SOURCE
$ ./gradlew jar
$ javap -v build/classes/java/main/annotations/MyCustomAnnotation.class

In the `Example` class information, there's no information on the
annotations. In annotation class information, you can see that
the retention is `SOURCE`. 

Let's check for `CLASS` and `RUNTIME`

```bash
$ # with RetentionPolicy.CLASS
$ ./gradlew jar
$ javap -v build/classes/java/main/annotations/MyCustomAnnotation.class

This time we are able to see the annotations in the `Example` class, but these annotations
won't be available at runtime - they will be discarded when the class loader
loads the classes. If you look closely at the above information, it says "RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations".
Funnily I was reading this as "RuntimeVisibleAnnotations" and thinking how weird it was 🤣 Anyways,
with that out of the way, it's clear when the program is running - it cannot
read the annotation, or the information provided along with the annotation as elements.

Now you can see that it clearly says that there are "RuntimeVisibleAnnotations", and what
they are.

Apparently runtime retention policy is the most used when it comes to custom annotations.
It's available during runtime and can be read and processed. 

For `SOURCE` and `CLASS`, there are few uses I guess.

`SOURCE` - When you are writing some tools for an editor or writing a build tool
which reads the source code and does stuff, then this can be pretty useful, and the
annotations will not go into the .class files, and so they will not be polluted.

`CLASS` - This can be used when you need post compile processing, but not runtime.
For runtime, you would need `RUNTIME`. Post compile time means - after you generate
byte code. So yeah, tools that work on or process byte code could use annotations
that have this retention policy.
